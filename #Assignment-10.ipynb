    "1. What is the role of try and exception block?\n",
    "A. The role of a try-except block, also known as an exception handling block, is to handle and manage exceptions in a program. Exceptions are events or conditions that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a try-except block works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The code that may potentially raise an exception is placed within the \"try\" block. This section is where the normal execution of the program occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.If an exception is raised within the \"try\" block, the program's execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding \"except\" block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.The \"except\" block contains the code that handles the exception. It specifies how the program should respond to a particular type of exception. Multiple \"except\" blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Once the exception is handled within the \"except\" block, the program continues executing the code after the \"except\" block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-except block allows you to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent the program from crashing or terminating abruptly. It provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions, enabling you to take appropriate actions, such as displaying an error message, logging the error, or performing alternative computations.\n",
    "\n",

    "    # ...\n",
    "    Let's break down the components of the basic try-except block:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The 'try' keyword marks the start of the try block, where you place the code that may potentially raise an exception.\n",
    "2.Inside the try block, you include the statements that you want to execute. If an exception occurs within this block, the execution of the block is immediately halted, and the program jumps to the corresponding'except'block.\n",
    "3.The except keyword is followed by the type of exception you want to handle. This can be a specific exception class (e.g., ValueError, TypeError) or a base exception class (e.g., Exception) that can handle multiple types of exceptions. If an exception of the specified type occurs, the code within the corresponding except block is executed.\n",
    "4.Inside the except block, you include the statements that handle the exception. This can involve displaying an error message, logging the error, or performing any necessary actions to handle the exception gracefully.\n",
    "5.You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions. They should be listed in the order from the most specific to the more general types."

    "A.If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle that specific type of exception, the program will terminate abruptly, and an error message will be displayed. This is known as an unhandled exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised and not handled by an except block, the program's default exception handler takes over. The default behavior typically includes printing a traceback message that shows the details of the exception, such as the type of exception, the line of code where it occurred, and the call stack leading up to the exception. After displaying the traceback, the program terminates.\n",

    "4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type?\n",

    ":It is preferable to handle exceptions selectively and only catch the specific exceptions that you expect and know how to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Specific Exception Type:\n",
